# kinect_recognition
Real-time face recognition system using Kinect depth/color streams, OpenCV, and ArcFace ONNX. Includes face detection, embedding, verification, and basic depth-based liveness check. Needs refactoring for modularity, better JSON handling, and more robust error control.


Code review

Overall, the code is solid — it integrates Kinect depth/color streams, OpenCV for detection, and ArcFace ONNX for embeddings in a pretty clean way. It’s a good working prototype for real-time face recognition with liveness detection. The functionality is there, but the structure could use some refactoring to make it maintainable and less fragile.

Main points:

Monolithic main()
The main loop is doing everything — Kinect IO, DNN inference, face detection, UI, and database updates. It’s hard to follow and debug.
Suggest splitting it into smaller functions like processFrame(), handleEnrollment(), and handleVerification(). Even better, wrap the logic into a few small classes (KinectManager, FaceRecognizer, FaceDB).

Global state
Too many global variables: g_sensor, g_db, g_faceNet, g_faceCascade, etc. This makes the code harder to test and reuse. Move these into classes or namespaces. Static/global singletons are fine for a quick demo but not for production.

Hardcoded paths
The cascade, ONNX model, and DB paths are hardcoded. Use a simple config (JSON, YAML, or command-line args) instead. It will make deployment much easier.

Manual JSON parsing
The JSON parsing in loadDbJSON() is too brittle — one misplaced space or comma will break it. Use a proper JSON library like nlohmann::json or rapidjson. It’ll simplify both load and save logic and reduce the chance of corrupted DB files.

Error handling
A lot of Kinect and file operations just return false or continue without clear error messages. Log the exact cause of failure (missing device, file not found, invalid frame, etc.). This is critical when running on different systems.

Magic numbers
Constants like 0.62f for similarity, depth thresholds (200–5000), and sigma > 15 should be named and explained. It’s fine to tune them experimentally, but they should be easy to adjust and documented.

Resource safety
Frame locking/unlocking looks correct, but the nested continue statements make it easy to miss a release call. Wrap Kinect frames in small RAII structs to guarantee UnlockRect/ReleaseFrame calls even on early returns.

Liveness check
The depth-based heuristic is fine for a demo but not very robust. It might fail on noisy sensors or uneven lighting. You could average multiple frames or add temporal checks for stability.

Face detection
Haar cascades work but are outdated. Consider replacing them with OpenCV DNN face detector (ResNet10 SSD) or RetinaFace if performance allows. The detection quality would improve a lot.

Embedding normalization
The ArcFace embedding normalization is done correctly. Still, consider caching embeddings or skipping re-embedding if the face doesn’t move much frame-to-frame — it’ll reduce CPU load.

Localization
setlocale(LC_ALL, "Russian") is fine for console output, but if you ever plan to deploy or log to files, switch to UTF-8 and drop locale-specific formatting.

General structure
The project mixes Kinect code, face recognition, and data persistence in a single file. That’s okay for an experiment, but it should be split into at least three source files (kinect.cpp, face.cpp, db.cpp) with a header for each.
